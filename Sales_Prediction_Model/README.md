# 📈 Sales Prediction System

A complete Machine Learning project that predicts future product sales using historical Superstore sales data.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, model evaluation, model comparison, model deployment, and a Streamlit web application for real-time sales prediction.

---

# 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a Sales Prediction Model capable of estimating future sales using customer information, product details, shipping information, and order history.

Three Machine Learning algorithms were trained and compared:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

Among these, **Random Forest Regression** achieved the highest prediction accuracy and was selected as the final model for deployment.
